var canvas;
var Image;
var angle = 0;
var xpos, ypos; // Starting position of shape

var widthheight = 100;

var xspeed = 2.8; // Speed of the shape
var yspeed = 2.2; // Speed of the shape

var xdirection = 1; // Left or Right
var ydirection = 1; // Top to Bottom


function setup() 
{
  canvas = createCanvas(500,500);
  Image = loadImage("Images/background.jpg");

   imageMode(CENTER);

    xpos = 500/2 ;
    ypos = 500 /2;
}

function draw() 
{
  background('gray');

    xpos = xpos + xspeed * xdirection;
    ypos = ypos + yspeed * ydirection;



    // Test to see if the shape exceeds the boundaries of the screen
    // If it does, reverse its direction by multiplying by -1
    if (xpos > width - widthheight || xpos < widthheight)
    {
        xdirection *= -1;
    }
    if (ypos > height - widthheight || ypos < widthheight)
    {
        ydirection *=  -1;
    }

    translate(10,10);
    rotate(angle);
    imageMode(CENTER);
    angle = angle + 0.0019;
    image(Image,xpos,ypos,widthheight,widthheight);

}


This is my code for roating image as well as image movement.

in this i got some error like image is rotating as well as moving but its going out of canvas.

so please help
